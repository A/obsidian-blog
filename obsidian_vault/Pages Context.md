### Page Context

This is the page context can be used in a template:

```
{
  "slug": str,  # url, generated by sluggifying the filename
  "meta": dict[str, any], # the frontmatter section goes here
}
```

And also you can get an array contains all pages as part of the `global_context` from the `pages` variable in templates, which might be convenient to automatically make links to them in menu, etc.
