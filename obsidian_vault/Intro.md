This is a first post in the blog generated by `obsidian-blog` from [Obsidinan.md][obsidian] vault.

`obsidian-blog` is a simple static site generator like [Jekyll][jekyll] written in Python, allows you to use your notes to write blog posts. Imagin you can write you blog posts right in obsidian in a [MoCs][moc] manner, getting all wild power of [Zettelkasten][zettelkasten], and avoiding content duplication.

Sounds interesting, isn't it?

But need to mention, `obsidian-blog` is not a ready to go blog, it's a static site generator orchestrates [handlebars][handlebars], [markdown][markdown], [frontmatter][frontmatter],  and bunch of methods to properly process obsidian notes. The blog implementation is up to you. It's quite easy, but it requires some codding skills.
