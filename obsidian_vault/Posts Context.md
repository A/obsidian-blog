### Posts Context

This is the post context in the templates:

```
{
  "file": str, # filename
  "slug": str, # url, generated by sluggifying the filename
  "html": str, # rendered html of the post
  "meta": Meta, # frontmatter metadata
  "imgs": list[Image], # list of images in the post
})

```

As well as for pages, all posts are included to the `posts` variable of the `global_context`, which was shown before in the `main.hbs` layout example.
